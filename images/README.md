This directory contains example images generated using this library.

For ease of searching for mosaic images each directory contains `README.md` file.

 * [Logo](logo.png) of the project.
 * [starry_mosaic](starry_mosaic/README.md) - contains mosaic images
created using `starry_mosaic::StarryMosaic` (or `starry_mosaic::MosaicBuilder::build_star`);
these images are based on [Voronoi diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram).
 * [polygonal_mosaic](polygonal_mosaic/README.md) - contains mosaic images
created using `starry_mosaic::PolygonalMosaic` (or `starry_mosaic::MosaicBuilder::build_polygon`);
such images are based on [Delaunay triangulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation).
